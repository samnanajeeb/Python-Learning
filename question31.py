""" 31. Write a Python program to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) 
of two positive integers.
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two nonzero integers a and b is the 
greatest positive integer d such that d is a divisor of both a and b; 
that is, there are integers e and f such that a = de and b = df, 
and d is the largest such integer. 
The GCD of a and b is generally denoted gcd(a, b)."""
