"""Python defines an in-built module platform that provides system information.
The Platform module is used to retrieve as much possible information about 
the platform on which the program is being currently executed.
Now by platform info, it means information about the device, 
itâ€™s OS, node, OS version, Python version, etc. 
This module plays a crucial role when you want to check whether your program is 
compatible with the python version installed on a particular system or 
whether the hardware specifications meet the requirements of your program"""
